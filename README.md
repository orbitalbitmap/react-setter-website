# React Setter Administration Tool
The React Setter Administration Tool is a private webapp that collects, stores, and displays relevant climbing gym management information. This app uses a navigable dashboard to display and edit gym locations, wall climbing routes, difficulty distributions, route rotations, and other labeling tasks as needed.


## Usage

You can navigate to various other specialized areas via the navbar:\
1.Hello\
2.How\
3.Are\
